#  Interpreter Challenge in Rust build by CodeCrafters

This is solutions for Rust implementation of the ["Build Your Own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) on CodeCrafters.
In this challenge, I built The Lox Language Interpreter in Rust.

## Overview

The Lox Languague ([Lox Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)) is a dynamically typed, interpreted language with a C-like syntax. It supports features like variables, control structures, functions, and classes.

## Resources
- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/): A book by Bob Nystrom that guides you through building an interpreter for Lox.
